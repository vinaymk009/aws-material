Connecting two VPCs are called "Peering".

1. After creating another VPC(PeeringVPC) completed.

2. Go to Your VPC's page and copy the url 

	https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home?region=us-east-1#vpcs:

3. Open another window in the browser and paste , change the us-east-2(Ohio region)
	https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/home?region=us-east-2#vpcs:
	(By Default, one vpc is there we are using this as Ohio-BranchVPC)

4. My Task is first , I would like establish peering between 
	- AWS-25OCTVPC & PEERINGVPC (in the same region)
     Next I would like to establish peering between 
	-AWS-25OCTVPC  & OHIO BRANCH VPC
	(see the image)

5. NorthVirginia( window)
	-EC2 Launch one server"Oct25AWSServer" and place under  AWS-25OCT VPC
	-In the similar way create another server "NewPeering26Server" under NewPeeringVpc26

6. Now , OHIO(Window)
	-Need to create an server here as well, but here we didn't find any key-pair.As we know that Key-pair is region specific.
	-Need to import the key pair from N.virginia into Ohio.
	-click on "import KeyPair", and browse for the .pem file which we have downloaded at the time of launching the machine, but it
	  throws an error.Need to follow the following way to import the keypair.
	 
	steps:
		-now connect to AWS25Server in (N.Virginia region) using SSH.
		-once connected, then type
			[ec2-user@ip-10-1-1-100 ~]$ ec2-metadata
		-now copy the following code from it
			 ssh-rsa to AWS-25AUG
		-Now, comeback to Ohio Region window and click on "Import Key Pair" and paste the "ssh-rsa complete key" and click on import key.with this
		  the key which is in N.virginia can be used in Ohio region as well.

    6.1 Now, launch the EC2 Server in Ohio as well.

7. N.Virginia(Region)
	  -Open SSH and connect to the AWSServer
	  -Open SSH and Connect to the PeeringServer

8. Ohio(Region)server
	-Open SSH and connect to the OhioServer

9. By default , no servers were having the communication between the VPCs.
	(show the image)
	-need to check now, the communication between the servers.
	  from Ohioserver to N.Virginia Server
		[root@ip-172-31-1-100 ~]# ping 10.1.1.100
		  PING 10.1.1.100 (10.1.1.100) 56(84) bytes of data. (no communication as of now)
	-No servers were communicating between the VPCs.So, now we need to establish the Peering between VPCs

===============================================================================
10. Establishing the Peering Connections 
	Under the VPC services we have the "PeeringConnections"
	Note: When we establishing peering connections the CIDR ip address should not have same IPaddress, if same address are there then
	           it will throws an error
		"A Peering Connection cannot be created between 2 VPCs that have overlapping CIDRs. Please select 2 VPCs which have distinct CIDRs"
	-Now I am establishing the peering connections within the same region.(AWS25OCTVPC and PeeringVPC in N.Virginia)
	-  Provide the relavant VPCs name which we want to connect.
	-once created then goto actions--> Accept Request-->Accept Peering VPC Connection Request--> click on "Yes,Accept"

11. Modify Routing table (N.Virginia)
	-AWS-25AUG-RTB
		-Routes TAB 
			Edit=AddAnotherRoute->192.168.0.0/16 and select "AWS25AUGtoPeeringVPC".
	Similarly,
	-PeeringVPC-RTB
		Routes TAB 
			Edit=AddAnotherRoute->10.1.0.0/16 and select "AWS25AUGtoPeeringVPC".

12. Now, open the two session on SSH, 
		[root@ip-10-1-1-100 ~]# ping 192.168.1.100

		other window
		[root@ip-192-168-1-100 ~]# ping 10.1.1.100

==================================================
13. Now Establishing the peering connection between North Virginia and Ohio i.e inter connection

	Create Peering Connection (N.Virginia)
		
	Peering connection name tag=AWS-25AUGVPC-to-OhioPeering
	Select VPC =AWS-25AUG
	Select another VPC to peer with
		Region=Another Region
			Ohio(us-east-2)
	VPC Acceptor= go to the ohio region and select the VPC id and paste it here.
		VPCid=	vpc-5da79535
	click on "Create a PeeringConnection"

14. After creating the peering connection, in Actions--->Accept request is grey out , because "pending acceptance" to be done to the region where we requested for 
	i.e. need to go Ohio Region, peering connections  there need to "Accept Request "

15. Ohio Region
	modify routing table 
		"add another route" =10.1.4.0/24"
	save 
16. N.Virginia

	Routing Table
		
		another route=172.31.1.0/24
		select="AWS25AUGVPCtoOhioPeering"
	save
		
		
17. Now check in SSHs 
	[root@ip-10-1-1-100 ~]# ping 172.31.1.100
	
	from 
	[root@ip-172.31.1.100 ~]# ping 10-1-4-100

Peering is done.
