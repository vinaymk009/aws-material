Elastic Load Balancing

Load Balancer is nothing but which balances the load.

ELB helps an IT team adjust capacity according to incoming application and network traffic. Users enable ELB within a single availability zone or across multiple availability zones to maintain consistent application performance.load balancing divides the amount of work that a computer has to do among multiple computers so that users, in general, get served faster.

Elastic Load Balancing supports three types of load balancers: 
3 Types

1. ALB - Application Load Balancers

2. NLB - Network Load Balancers (new)

3. Classic Load Balancers. (Old )

Choose the load balancer type that meets your needs.

-Load balancer is  depending on VPCs
InterviewQuestion:
	-Load balancing can be done only in one VPC that too in the same region only.
	-but it doesn't balance betwen two different regions.
	- if you want to establish the load balaning 
	  between two regions then it possible through 'Route53'


==============================
Now, I would like to install 3 instances in three different availability zones to show the load balancing


Launch Instance -(server-1a)
=============

at step3:
	primary ip =10.1.1.100

	Advanced Details
		add the following script to install the 'nginx' webserver
		 #!/bin/bash

		yum update -y
		yum install nginx -y
		service nginx start  


- After launch the instance copy the public-DNS(ipv4) url and paste in the new window of your browser.It should display the 'Nginx' home page.
  Indicates that, nginx webserver service is starts.

Launch Instance(server-1b)
	
At Step3:
	primary ip=10.1.2.100
	Advanced Details
	add the following script to install the 'nginx' webserver
		 #!/bin/bash
	  	    yum update -y
		   yum install nginx -y
		   service nginx start  

- After launch the instance copy the public-DNS(ipv4) url and paste in the new window of your browser.It should display the 'Nginx' home page.
  Indicates that, nginx webserver service is starts.

Launch Instance(server-1b)
	
At Step3:
	primary ip=10.1.3.100
	Advanced Details
	add the following script to install the 'nginx' webserver
		 #!/bin/bash
	  	    yum update -y
		   yum install nginx -y
		   service nginx start  

- After launch the instance copy the public-DNS(ipv4) url and paste in the new window of your browser.It should display the 'Nginx' home page.
  Indicates that, nginx webserver service is starts.

Or
If it is not install manually you can install nginx into this instance.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
But here, one problem I am getting, that is the server which I am logged in it displays the 'nginx' webpage. ofcourse in real time also displays like that only.
But how can I show you that 'load balancing' is working. So, I would like to make some changes to the nginx webpage.
for that
Connect the machine using SSH

1. Connect to the 'Server-1a' machine
	make some changes in index.html of the nginx webpage
	[root@ip-10-1-1-100 ~]# vim /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
	
	Open Browser
	   copy the publicDNS(ipv4) id
		http://ec2-18-208-164-191.compute-1.amazonaws.com/	

(do the same above for the other two instances 'server-1b, server-1c')


2. Create a target group
	Target groupname= 'webapp'(any name you can give)
	
	<create target group>
	
    select the target group, which created 
	select tab 'targets'
	Edit
	   check the 'server-1a',server-1b' and click on 'Add to registered'

3. Create 'Load Balancing'
	tcp=create
	name=sreenlb
	load balance=TCP
	protocol=80

	select relevant vpc
	availabilityzone
		- select all subnets
	after complete the other steps in it.

4. by default it will generate the DNS Name, after creating the load balancer like below:

	knowledgeit-0aae284925b3318c.elb.us-east-1.amazonaws.com

5. To remember this DNS hostname is difficult for any user.
	for that purpose we need to configure the DNS hostname using Route53.
	(Add any of your registered domain name and check in Route53)

	Open Route53
	-Create HostedZone
		Domain Name=anilkumar.org.in
		
	-createRecordSet
		Name=www.anilkumar.org.in
		Alias=yes
		AliasTarget= it displays the DNS name of your LoadBalancer
		
	<create>

	T

6. Add the Server-1c  into the target group
	Target Group
	  Edit
	     add 'server-1c' --click on <addtoregistered>
	open browser
		 sreenlb-5762c3d3d3196467.elb.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
	you should get mostly server-1c

7. Now, to check the load balancing...I am stopping ther nginx service in server-1a and server -1b
	[root@ip-10-1-1-100 ~]# service nginx stop
	[root@ip-10-1-2-100 ~]# service nginx stop

	open browser
		 sreenlb-5762c3d3d3196467.elb.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
	
	output:
	   it should come for all 'server-1c' only.
