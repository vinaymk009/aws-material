Public Subnet   = Subnets which are connected to IGW(Internet Gateway) directly is  a Public Subnet.

Private Subnet = Subnets which are not connected to IGW(Internet Gateway) directly is  a Private Subnet.

Steps:
=====
  

	
1. Open the Subnets and select the Routing  Table name from it " AWS-25OCT-RTB".
	
    - Open the Routing Table and copy the "AWS-25OCT-RTB" in the filter and now check the Routes. If you can observe here, all the three subnets are associated with this  routing 
      "AWS-25OCT-RTB", which means it is Public Subnet.
    -All the 3 subnets are directly connecting to the IGW through the Routing Table.
	
     -Create new Subnet called as "AWS-25OCT-Database" and give IP range as 10.1.7.0/24
	Name=AWS-25OCT-Database
	VPC= AWS-25OCT
	Avail.zone=us-east-1a
	IPv4=10.1.7.0/24

(Note: Here we are not associate this subnet "AWS-25OCT-Database" to the Routing table , because we are here to show the difference between public and private subnets).
	(Check Image of VPC image1)

2. Enable Public IP assigning on AWS-25OCT-Database
      -Select the subnet "AWS-25OCT-Database",  Rightclick Modify auto-assign IP and --> check the bo "Enable auto-assign public IPv4 address"


3. Deploy two instances, one in Subnet-1(Public) and other in AWS-25OCT-Database(Private)
	Goto EC2
	 - Launch Two instances here one is Public and other is Private.
	 - "PublicServer" and "DBServer"
	(Note:publicserver ipv4=10.1.4.100 and DBserver IPv4=10.1.7.100)

	-Open the command prompt and ping the public ip 
		IPv4 Public IP =18.234.190.179  
		of "PublicServer" and check. We can get the response from it.

	-Open SSH and connect to the "publicserver".

	-After launching the DBServer machine, copy the private ip and check in the command prompt.It should not connect as of now.it throws an error "Request timeout" .
                Because we didn't launch the NAT Server here,it is coming from outside through the IGW but, it is don't know where to go,  here internet packet is dropping.

	

4. Check the communication for Public instance and DB Instance.
	- in SSH, check the connectivity between "publicserver" and "DBServer"
	 [root@ip-10-1-4-100 ~]# ping 10.1.7.100
	-Connectivity is successful

5. Deploy a NAT Gateway. While deploying make sure you choose public subnet.
	 -NAT gateway allows  Only Outbound
	 -IGW allows both inbound and outbound

	VPCs--->NAT Gateways  -> Create NAT Gateway---> Copy the  subnet1a id from the "AWS-25OCT-Subnet1"--->
	 (Need to add the ElasticIP here) click on "create NewEIP" New EIP (100.24.184.109) creation successful.
	

6. Create new routing table for "AWS-25OCT-Database" and add routing towards NAT Gateway.
	-Route Tables
	   -Create RouteTable --> Provide the
				NameTag=  "AWS-25OCT-NAT"
				VPC= select the AWS-25OCT
	- Need to attach the subnets to it.
		subnetAssociations=select only "AWS-25OCT-Database" subnet.
		Route
			Destination=0.0.0.0/0
			Target = select the nat.
	(Note: if we select the igw here, this subnet also becomes public subnet,so need to select the NAT)

	Now, EC2
	    -Open DBServer machine and connect through SSH using public key.Actually now with this step , I should get error "connection timeout "
	    -How to connect to the DBServer, then take the duplicate session of ssh now, and through ssh and DBserver PrivateIP. Still we get the error here.

		[root@ip-10-1-4-100 ~]# ssh ec2-user@10.1.7.100
	
	 - To connect we need to use the key
		Open the EC2Machine , and Vim Editor
			-[root@ip-10-1-4-100 ~]# vi AWS-25OCT.pem
			-copy the AWS-25OCT.pem file from where the save location and paste in "AWS-25OCT.pem" file, save and exit
			-Now try again, 
				[root@ip-10-1-4-100 ~]# ssh -i AWS-25OCT.pem ec2-user@10.1.7.100
			-got error again, due to security.
			-change the permission of file
				[root@ip-10-1-4-100 ~]# chmod 400 AWS-25OCT.pem
				[root@ip-10-1-4-100 ~]# ll
			-Now, try to connect 
				[root@ip-10-1-4-100 ~]# ssh -i AWS-25OCT.pem ec2-user@10.1.7.100
			-Successful this time
				[ec2-user@ip-10-1-7-100 ~]$ sudo su -
			-check the internet connectivity fromt here
				[root@ip-10-1-7-100 ~]# ping www.google.com

	
	Now, I need to change the Route table for the AWS-25OCT-NAT, route and then check the ping again.
			Destination=10.0.0.0/8
			Target = select the nat.
			[root@ip-10-1-7-100 ~]# ping www.google.com 
			Now, internet is not coming through this. Again  change it to previous settings in routing table
			Destination=0.0.0.0/0
			Target = select the nat

		Now, again
		[root@ip-10-1-7-100 ~]# ping www.google.com 
		packets are coming through this NAT. Now, to prove that, internet is coming through the NAT only again make following changes.
		Route
			Destination=0.0.0.0/0
			Target=select the NAT



InterviewQuestion: I have the Public IP for the Database server but still , I could not connect to the EC2 machine why?
		(Ans: If it is a Database Server, we should have NAT server to connect it.Because it is for the security)

7. SSH to public Instance and from there SSH in to DB1 Instance and ping www.google.com and it should be reachable.

8. Prove the traffic is going through NAT Gateway.



Important Note:
	NATGateway is not free, it is going to be billed. So, once you complete your practice, need to delete it.
Before this, need to terminate the EC2 machines.
1. UnderVPCs--->NAT Gateways-->RightClick Delete NAT
2. Even after delete , "Elastic IPs" are using the sources, so, once NAT is deleted.
3. VPCs---> ElasticIPs-> R.Click and RelaseIPs.
With the above steps, NAT is completely deleted.
