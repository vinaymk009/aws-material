aws s3 sync s3://wildrydes-us-east-1/WebApplication/1_StaticWebHosting/website s3://www.androidapple.com --region us-east-1
==================================================================================


S3 	-Simple Storage SErvice 
	-Also called as Object Storage(EBS Storage)
	
EFS	-Elastic File System
	-its like Shared Folders for Windows
	-NFS(Network file system) for Linux

Glaciers are like Archive or Backups

Bucket
	-Ec2,AMI ,Snapshots are storing in S3 storage in the background
	-Most of the static data is in S3 only.
	-AWS locks,Cloud trial,Audit locking

	-Bucket naming should be unique in AWS S3.
	-S3 is Global(but not exactly global)
	-IAM is purely global

	-To keep the data into S3 need to create bucket and store data into it.

aws s3 sync s3://wildrydes-us-east-1/WebApplication/1_StaticWebHosting/website s3://www.hydmicrosoft.com --region us-east-1



1.Storage
	S3
	-<createbucket>
		Bucket name =www.techstore.com
		Region (by default it will select us-east(N.Virginia))
	Properties
		uncheck all the check boxes
		<createbucket>


2. Once bucket has created, 'select' the www.techstore.com.
	<copyBucketARN>
	ARN=Amazon Resource Name
		arn:aws:s3:::www.techstore.com
	(Need to place this 'arn format' in script or when we write the bucket policies)

3.Add/upload some files into the bucket
	-Any type of files we can upload
	-by default when you upload some files into this bucket. A url will be generated for this individual files
	-click the link and open in new tab
		https://s3.amazonaws.com/www.techstore.com/MyWordlist.txt
	    but it will not display as we didn't make this file as 'public'
	To make the file as public, select  the file 
			Actions- MakePublic
	-Now refresh the browser tab , it will display the file content.

4.Properties Tab
	-Open Browser 'aws cli downloads'
	-https://docs.amazonaws.cn/en_us/cli/latest/userguide/awscli-install-windows.html
	-Open command prompt
		C:\Users\India>aws

5. Open IAM
	<adduser>
		User name =S3user
		Access type=Programmatic access
	<nextpermissions>
	
	AttachExistingPolicies <tab>
		Filterpolicies=S3F
			'select' AmazonS3FullAccess
		<review>

		<createuser>
	(Now, we get the accesskey and secret key)
	
	Access Key ID=AKIAJ2VSTI5JVTSMDPLA 
	Secret Access Key= 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



6. Open command prompt
	C:\Users\India>aws configure
	AWS Access Key ID [****************VJCA]: AKIAJ2VSTI5JVTSMDPLA
	AWS Secret Access Key [****************iJKe]: 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
	Default region name [us-east-1]: us-east-1
	Default output format [table]: table

	C:\Users\India>aws s3 ls
	C:\Users\India>aws s3 ls
	2018-12-04 13:02:30 www.androidapple.com
	2018-11-06 09:44:23 www.classroomaws.in
	2018-12-04 23:58:14 www.techstore.com
	
	(Note:why I am showing this AWS CLI is, when we download and configure the static website hosting. Through this CLI files can be fastly downloaded)


7. Versioning
    =======
	-Go back to bucket and delete the uploaded files
	-When we delete the files from here, we can't get back, we lost those files.So, if we want to get back the files,though if it was deleted.
	
	Enable the Versioning.
		-Open Notepad file
		-add some text into it and upload the file into the bucket.
		-by making some changes into it, upload the file into the bucket and overwrite the file.
		-select the file and 
		       actions->make public
		-Now we can see the file in the browser,because we make it public.
		-Observe now, now link Version,hide and show are visible after enabled the Versioning.
		-Now delete the file from the bucket, but click on the link 'show'. It displays the versioning of your files


8.Static Website Hosting
   =============
	'select 'Use this bucket to host a website
		index document	
			index.html
		Error document
			error.html	
		<save>
	
	Now, I will place a website into it.

	-Open Browser search 'wildrydes github'
	-select _static WebHosting
	-https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-serverless-workshops/tree/master/WebApplication/1_StaticWebHosting
	
	Upload Content
		CLI step-by-step instructions (expand for details)
		-aws s3 sync s3://wildrydes-us-east-1/WebApplication/1_StaticWebHosting/website s3://YOUR_BUCKET_NAME --region YOUR_BUCKET_REGION

		aws s3 sync s3://wildrydes-us-east-1/WebApplication/1_StaticWebHosting/website s3://www.techstore.com --region us-east-1
		
	
	Open Command prompt
	-it downloads all the website files into it.
	C:\Users\India>aws s3 sync s3://wildrydes-us-east-1/WebApplication/1_StaticWebHosting/website s3://www.techstore.com --region us-east-1

	-Manually to download these files are difficult that is why we use AWS CLI

9. Bucket files, screen and refresh it.
	- we can see all the website files are visible here now.
	-select the index.html and open the url in the browser, but we can't see the content. Because we didn't make it public
	-select index.html 
		actions-make public
	- refresh the browser


10.Properties
     ======
	S3Pricing

	https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/

	Transfer Acceleration
		Use the new accelerated endpoint for faster data transfers, which will incur an additional fee
		- It will use to upload the data into the servers.
		-especially, for the media houses it will be useful for them.

	
    How far our data storage is safe in S3?

	- We are uploading the files into the Bucket but, how far these files are secured.
	-we have two main things in S3
		1. Availability = Service Uptime 
			         -they provide 99.99%
			         -https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_availability
				-Planned downtime that is intimated 6 months before.
				-unplanned downtime 	

		2. Durability =How safe our data
			   	-AWS providing 99.999999999%
				  i.e if we upload 1000 files, then in the next 10 thousand years only one file might be lost.
			
			Standard  = It keeps 3 copies of data

			Standard -IA(infrequent access)=keeps 3 copies of data
			OneZone = keep only one copy of data
			Reduced Redundancy
